#   Create a data model for a AirBnb.com system.
#       Your model should give ability to store information about
#           the users
#           the rooms
#           the reservations
#           and the reviews
#       You should have two types of users:
#           Hosts
#           Guests
#
#   Host should be able
#       to create rooms with different attributes (amount of residents, price, A/C, refrigerator, etc.)
#   Guest should be able to make a
#       Check availability of any roomsMake
#       Reservation for a room.
#
#   For each table you should describe
#       what is the primary key and
#       what are the foreign keys (if any).
#
#   Result of the work might be description in a table.
#   You can create tables in text file with description of each field.
#   You also can you any graphic tool that you might use to create data model.
#   I usually use DRAW.io for such thing, but might choose another tool.
#
#   (Optional): Add these possibilities for a guest
#       Pay for reservation
#       Review for the host.
